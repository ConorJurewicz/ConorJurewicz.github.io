    <p class="p-qoute">"The person who gazes in the mirror receives an awareness of his other half, his shadow, or hidden man; awareness of that hidden man is a proper aim for all initiation. The experience teaches him that the eyes he sees are not just “him,” but some other man, not included very well under the name his parents gave him, Edward or Lance or Kerry. These eyes belong to some other being whom we have never met." </p>

    <p class="p-review">A perfect read for all young men attempting to find the path to manhood. Bly goes over what it means to be a man, the common problems of manhood, and how to become a man yourself. He does this by using beautiful poetry and ancient legends. This book is eye-opening and gives you a new perspective on everything. </p>
