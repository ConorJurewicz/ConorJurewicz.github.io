    <p class="p-qoute">"The person who gazes in the mirror receives an awareness of his other half, his shadow, or hidden man; awareness of that hidden man is a proper aim for all initiation. The experience teaches him that the eyes he sees are not just “him,” but some other man, not included very well under the name his parents gave him, Edward or Lance or Kerry. These eyes belong to some other being whom we have never met." </p>

    <p class="p-review">A perfect read for all young men attempting to find the path to manhood. Bly goes over what it means to be a man, the common problems of manhood, and how to enter manhood yourself. He does this by using beautiful poetry and ancient legends. This book is eye-opening and gives you a new perspective on everything. </p>

    <p class="p-qoute">"You must discipline
        yourself carefully. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself,
        so that you can trust and motivate yourself. You need to determine how to act toward
        yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person. It would be
        good to make the world a better place. Heaven, after all, will not arrive of its own accord.
        We will have to work to bring it about, and strengthen ourselves, so that we can
        withstand the deadly angels and flaming sword of judgment that God used to bar its
        entrance.

    <br>
    <p class="p-review">A self-help book full of depth that will drastically improve anyone’s life. Not only does Dr. Peterson tell you how to conduct yourself, but why to conduct yourself in such a manner. Why should we stand tall with our shoulders straight? Why should we even bother taking care of ourselves? Who do we want to be, and why? The twelve rules he carefully explains answer such questions.
