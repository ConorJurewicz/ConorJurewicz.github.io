            Books are more powerful than words can describe. Which is sort of ironic, 
            but that is the beauty in them. Such beauty and truth do they hold. A good book changes someones life drastically.
            On this website I do my best job to list the books that have changed my life in a most positive way. I 
            apologize as this is my first website so it may be a little janky.
